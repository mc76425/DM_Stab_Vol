Study of no corrected longitudinal dynamic stability of an X-15
main1.m: fist try with simplification for damping factors and Natural frequency
To do:
-Test wn and zeta calculations with eigenvalues
-Transfert Functions of each variable
-Finish all Curves

Conclusion: unstablility thx to lambda3>0 seems logical according to the airplane
